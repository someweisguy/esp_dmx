    config DMX_ISR_IN_IRAM
        bool "Place DMX ISR functions in IRAM"
        default y
        select GPTIMER_ISR_IRAM_SAFE
        select GPTIMER_CTRL_FUNC_IN_IRAM
        help
            Placing DMX driver ISR functions in IRAM makes DMX functions
            slightly more performant. It allows the DMX driver to continue
            operation when cache is disabled. ESP-IDF v5 only: enabling this
            option places the GPTimer functions in IRAM as well.
    
    config DMX_MAX_PERSONALITIES
        int "Max DMX personalities"
        range 1 255
        default 16
        help
            This is the maximum number of DMX personalities that the DMX driver
            supports. Increasing this number increases the size of the DMX
            driver.

    config RDM_DEVICE_UID_MAN_ID
        hex "RDM manufacturer ID"
        range 0x0001 0x7fff
        default 0x05e0
        help
            Set the default manufacturer ID for this device's UID. The valid
            range is 0x0001 to 0x7fff (inclusive).

    config RDM_DEVICE_UID_DEV_ID
        hex "RDM device ID"
        range 0x00000000 0xffffffff
        default 0xffffffff
        help
            Set the default device ID for this device's UID. The valid
            range is 0x00000000 to 0xffffffff (inclusive). Setting this value to
            0xffffffff sets the device ID to its default value.
    
    config RDM_DEBUG_DEVICE_DISCOVERY
        bool "Debug RDM discovery"
        default n
        help
            Enabling this option can help to find bugs within the DMX driver's
            RDM discovery algorithm, but it can make the discovery process take
            longer. This option should remain disabled unless changes are being
            made to the RDM API.
    
    config RDM_STACK_ALLOCATE_DISCOVERY
        bool "Stack allocate RDM discovery address spaces"
        default n
        help
            RDM discovery needs over 500 bytes of memory. Enabling this option 
            instructs the DMX driver to allocate the needed memory on the stack
            instead of heap allocating it.
           
    config RDM_RESPONDER_MAX_PARAMETERS
        int "Max RDM responder PIDs"
        range 0 512
        default 16
        help
            This is the maximum number of RDM parameter responses that the DMX
            driver supports. Increasing this number increases the size of the
            DMX driver.
    
    config RDM_NVS_PARTITION_NAME
        string "NVS partition name for RDM parameters"
        default "nvs"
        help
            This is the NVS partition name in which supported RDM parameters are
            stored.
